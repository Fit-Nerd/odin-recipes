# odin-recipes
My first official Odin Project! 
This is the Odin Recipes project. I'll be creating a main index page with links to a few recipes, I'm assuming with absolute links.
This will utilize what I've learned about html thus far.

I will return after completing the project to review what I've applied, as well as what lessons I learned in its creation. 
Let's begin...

The project was fun to do and allowed for some creativity. 
Seeing what others have come up with was inspiring, too. I love the freedom we had with this project. 

Regarding commits; I need to improve in doing them in an atomic manner, and keep the "rules" of commits nearby, as they are clearly an important part of writing clean, legible code.
